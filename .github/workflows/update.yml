name: Alpha Update
# Alpha update requires write access to the repository to create a branch
# with the update files and allow you to open a pull request using the
# link provided in the issue. The branch created will be named in the
# format kubebuilder-update-from-<from-version>-to-<to-version> by default.
# To protect your codebase, please ensure that you have branch protection rules
# configured for your main branches. This will guarantee that no one can bypass a review
# and push directly to a branch like 'main'.
